### Example Queries and Agent Responses

Here are some example customer queries and the structured outputs generated by the AI Agent:

**Agent's Structured Output:**
```json

  "sentiment": "Neutral",
  "urgency": "High",
  "intent": "request_replacement",
  "delivery_status": null,
  "payment_method": null,
